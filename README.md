# WildMagicRoller
First self-made small project to try out some C# Coding, by making tools for dnd5e.

WildMagicRoller in its first stage, will be a form where you can input a number,
or roll a random number by simulating a d100 roll, and getting the corresponding
wild magic associated with the result.

Later versions have plans for making a second custom table to roll from, where you 
can input and remove your own custom results.
