# WildMagicRoller
First self-made small project to try out some C# Coding, by making tools for dnd5e.

Made with MVVM in mind, since it will most likely be ported over to a future app,
and it would be preferable to have a easy hook-up. The program will also read the 
result from an XML file, so one can easily add and remove without changing the solution.

WildMagicRoller in its first stage, will be a form where you can input a number,
or roll a random number by simulating a d100 roll, and getting the corresponding
wild magic associated with the result.

Later versions have plans for making a second custom table to roll from, where you 
can input and remove your own custom results. 

NB: The public test version will not contain official DnD 5E results, since they are
not a part of the free System Reference Document.
